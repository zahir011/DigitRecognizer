DigitRecognizer
A deep learning-based handwritten digit recognition project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow.

🚀 Overview
This project utilizes a trained CNN model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from images. The images are preprocessed, converted to grayscale, resized to 28×28 pixels, and then passed through the trained model for prediction.

📂 Dataset
You have handwritten digits captured on sticky notes.

Images are stored in a folder named "images".

Preprocessing includes grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Framework)

OpenCV (Image Processing)

NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib (Visualization)

🔧 Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/zahir011/DigitRecognizer.git
cd DigitRecognizer
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the folder "images" containing digit images.

🖼️ Preprocessing Steps
Convert images to grayscale.

Resize images to 28×28 pixels.

Normalize pixel values (0-1).

Reshape images for CNN input.

📜 How to Run the Code
